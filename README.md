# Personal Notes
Sharing some notes I've made about the technologies I'm learning.

They are written in my native language, brazilian portuguese. The writing is **not the most formal** though.

I'm sharing it here because it might be helpful, especially the troubleshooting sections.

> Those notes posted here are the ones i feel the most comfortable sharing at the moment, i might push more soon!
