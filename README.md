# Personal Notes
Sharing some notes I've made about the technologies I'm learning.

Including _at the moment_:
- [Javascript](Javascript.pdf)
- [Docker](Docker.pdf)
- [Kubernetes](Kubernetes.pdf)
- [ReactJS](React_JS.pdf)
- [ExpressJS](ExpressJS.pdf)
- [NodeJS](Node_JS.pdf)
- [CSS](CSS.pdf)
- [NumPy](NumPy.pdf)

It's all written in my native language, brazilian portuguese. **Not the most formal writing though.** 

I'm sharing it here because it might be helpful for someone, especially those troubleshooting sections.

> Notes posted are the ones i feel the most comfortable sharing, i might push some more later!
